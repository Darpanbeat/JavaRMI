RMI

1.Extract the files from the folder and it will have 5 files which are RMIinterface,Clientside,Serverside.

2.I have three different packages for interface, client and server. And in serverside package I have location and songs file that are called from servermain file.

3.You can execute this files in CMD or you can directly imports both folder into Eclipse IDE.

4.I recommend you to use Eclipse IDE because it was create in it so that it will be stable.

5.After importing the project start executing the servermain.java file and after the server starts try executing clientmain.java file.

6.Now you see the client gui on the screen and enter the artist name and select location or songs on the combobox and click submit.

7.The results will display on the client's textarea.
